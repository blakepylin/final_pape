  The motivation for this project comes from literature which examines the effect of free or low cost digital distribution of information goods on the demand on their physical counterparts. (Smith and Zentners 2016 review(1). 
  The is a breadth of resources which investigate the impact of illegal downloads. The bulk of this research focus on the impact of file sharing on music sales (2), while others look at the impact on the film industry(3). Recently, researchers has incorporated legal forms of cheap digital media distribution such as online streaming and found that it also shifted demand of more expensive substitutes(4). In these industries, the literature overall tends not to find that digital distribution shifts supply for the physical counterpart, which is perhaps due to digital distribution doe not explicitly improve the information environment.
  There are several key differences to low cost digital distribution for print media. Digitized print media that is scanned in by the entire text can be searched by the entire text, which enables a more complete match between the content and the users query. This match quality can increase demand because of the higher match quality.(5) Specifically, readers are able to find books that they would not want to read or not even know existed. Consumers who want a more user friendly format besides the low quality reader buy the physical book, entering the market.
  Another method of acquisition is checking the book out form the library. Books that may have been left on the shelf are now being checked out and read because people were made aware of their existence. However scanning books could also have the opposite effect on the demand for them. A book that’s easily available on google books could save a potential consumers a trip the book store or library, or the wait for the online order to deliver. Depending on what type of book the consumer seeks, it could even be more advantageous to have it in a digital format. Large textbooks for example offer a much more utility if they book itself can be queried for specific information, not to mention forgone cost of the physical version.
  Since the theoretical argument remains ambiguous, an empirical study into the causal effect is warranted. When designing a causal research question, model specification is key. The most common specification is Two Way Fixed Effects, which compares outcomes for observations with the treatment to observations without the treatment. It is a simple model design, which is flexible to various controls, but has a critical flaw. In circumstances when there are multiple treatment groups, Two Way Fixed Effects is specified in a way which causes observations which have been treated to be compared to newly treated observations. This contaminates the leading and lagging indicators when other assumptions are imposed like parallel trends and limited anticipation of the treatment.(6) The remedy for this issue is found in Callaway Sant'anna (7) specification, which bins the treated observations into time treated cohorts. This separates out the treatment effects and prevents overlapping. It also enables us to check the plausibility of prior trends and see how the treatment effect changes over time.
