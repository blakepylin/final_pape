Such an effect could be particu- larly salient in the market for books, where digital distribution can be accompanied by technologies that allow consumers to search through the full-text and discover (and buy) new content that would be otherwise hard to find (Ellison and Ellison, 2018). 

the Google Books digitization project. Launched in 2005, Google Books is one of the
landmark projects of the digital age, with commentators likening it to a “modern-day Library of Alexandria”
(Somers, 2017). Google Books did not just scan a book’s textual material but also made it searchable via
optical character recognition (OCR) technology through its “Google Book Search” feature (referenced by
Cambridge University Press in the epigraph). Further, a large portion of the Google Books corpus included
less well-known and older books (including public domain content) that are of significant consumer interest
but have become forgotten over time.

We tackle the empirical challenges through a unique natural experiment leveraging a research partnership with Harvard’s Widener Library, which provided books to seed the Google Books program. The digitization effort at Harvard only included out of copyright works, which – unlike in-copyright works – were made available to consumers in their entirety. This allows us to fairly assess the tradeoff between cannibalization (by a close substitute) and discovery (through search technology). Owing to the size of the collection, book digitization (and subsequent distribution) at Widener took over five years, providing signifi- cant variation in the timing of book digitization.

[EXPLAINING HOW THE MUTED EFFECT HELPS THEM IDENTIFY THE OVERALL EFFECT]
Next, we examine the importance of the discovery and substitution channels by studying two paral- lel settings where one of these two effects is muted. First, we investigate the effects of digitization on loans within the Harvard system. In this setting, the discovery effect is muted since Harvard students and professors already had access to alternate discovery mechanisms through library services. In this setting, digitization reduces rather than increases demand, measured as loans within Harvard. 

 [THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH Q]
Answering our research questions is important, not only because it helps make theoretical progress on the literature on cross-channel substitution, but also because of its industry and policy relevance. The net revenue of the book publishing industry in the US in 2019 was more than thrice as large as the music rev- enues (\$25.9B as compared to \$7.3B; AAP 2020 and RIAA 2020, respectively). Further, the advent of the internet, platforms like Amazon.com and mass digitization projects like Google Books have presented numerous questions about balancing physical sales, digital distribution (via e-books) and mass digital distribution (via projects like Google Books) for firms in the publishing industry. In fact, legal debates have analyzed the specific case we focus on (the Google Books project) and debated whether it increases or de- creases sales (Samuelson, 2009). Our research provides quasi-experimental evidence to policy-makers and legal scholars, who have largely relied on anecdotal and theoretical data up to this point.

\subsection{theory: How Nagaraj and Reimers think digitization is working wrt demand (and supply) for books}
How might digital distribution increase the sales of physical books? For end customers, the question of
whether the digitization of books increases or reduces demand for physical works depends on two counter-
acting forces. The first is the substitution effect of digital distribution as a competitor for existing, physical
products as studied in the literature. Some consumers who would otherwise consume physical copies will
switch to digital versions, driving the substitution effect. This is likely to happen when a consumer’s search
costs are low, and when she has a taste for digital consumption, and it may be less relevant when books are 

However, Google Books might stimulate a discovery effect due to increased awareness and searchability (see appendix Figure D.1.) Specifically, some consumers may start consuming the physical version for the first time, after digitization lowers search costs for books. This is likely to happen if they were made aware of a book through Google Books’ search engine and prefer to purchase physical copies rather than read online. This second mass of consumers will drive the discovery effect. The net effect of digitization is ambiguous and depends on the magnitude of these two margins.

The tradeoff between substitution and discovery further differs for different margins of books and con- sumers. Notably, for popular books, already well-known to consumers (e.g. The Wealth of Nations), the substitution effect is likely to dominate. On the other hand, obscure books are likely to benefit from discov- ery, and unlikely to face the costs of substitution. The effect of Google Books on demand should therefore be more positive for less popular books. In addition, if consumers discover a particular author through a dig- itized copy, they might also seek out other books by the same author, even if these have not been digitized. Therefore, digitization might lead to an increase in physical sales for non-digitized works of a digitized author as well.

Further, when the discovery channel is muted, the positive effects on demand should reduce or disappear altogether. For instance, for consumers within Harvard, who already benefit from access to search technol- ogy (through Harvard’s librarians and internal catalog system) the substitution effect is likely to dominate the discovery effect. Therefore, when considering loans within Harvard, the effect of digital distribution is likely much smaller, and even negative. On the flip side, when a digital platform provides access only to the search function, but not the entire text of the book (as is common with “snippet view”), we expect the positive effect of demand to remain strong. Our empirical analysis sheds light on these predictions as well.

To summarize, our theoretical predictions are threefold. First, digital distribution allows consumers to search for topics they are interested in and discover works previously unknown to them. Second, if the digital medium offers a poor substitute for a physical book, demand for physical works is more likely to increase. Finally, digital provision will also allow publishers (especially small and independent ones) to identify new material and introduce new editions.
Our theoretical arguments speak to past work on the impact of digital distribution on demand and supply for physical products. On the demand side, our arguments about the role of digital distribution in enhanc- ing consumer discovery add to work on the effects of digital technology on the diversity of consumption patterns (Brynjolfsson et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2014; Holtz et al., 2020). This work shows that digital distribution channels tend to change consumption patterns by helping consumers discover more novel and niche products. Related work has looked at the complementary effects of news content sampled via social networks, which drives traffic to news websites by helping consumers discover specific news articles (Chiou and Tucker, 2017; Sismeiro and Mahmood, 2018). However, this literature focuses on how digital channels change consumption patterns and has not explored how online access coupled with access to digital search and discovery tools affects demand for and supply of the same product in physical form. Our theoretical and empirical analyses extend this work in this direction.

On the supply side, past work has looked at other channels through which access to existing work improves the supply of new content. Most notably, the literature in copyright and digitization shows that free access to past work can often stimulate follow-on production of knowledge (Watson, 2017; Reimers, 2019; Heald, 2007). For example, the (copyright-related) digitization of magazine content improved the quality of content on Wikipedia (Nagaraj, 2018). Further, existing literature also suggests that digital access can be particularly helpful for smaller players and stimulate entry (Nagaraj, 2020; Zhang, 2018). However, whether or not digital distribution itself can improve the supply of physical products and whether it benefits smaller or larger players on this margin remains unexamined.
