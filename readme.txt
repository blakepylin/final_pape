to run code, user should: 

1. open your personal runme.do
2. where specified, copy and paste user's unique file path that points to the project directory. 
3. Running runme.do will make the master.dta panel as well as the tables necessary for the writeup. 

scolari_david_output.tex is located in the output folder. It will run after tables and figures have been built by runme.do and contingent do file. 

master.dta is in the data folder
